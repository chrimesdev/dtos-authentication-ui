# Authentication UI

User interface for the Authentication service for Screening.

Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [NHS Care Identity Service (CIS2)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/care-identity-service).

## Setup

Install the required dependencies using `pnpm install`

Then, run the development server in secure mode (SSL):

```bash
pnpm dev:secure
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Prerequisites

- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager

### Environment variables

Create a `.env` file to set environment variables required to run locally:

```
# Default
BASE_URL=https://localhost:3000
NODE_ENV=development
SERVICE_NAME="Screening"

# Next Auth
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://localhost:3000/api/auth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET={RANDOM_SECRET_STRING}

# CIS2 Auth
AUTH_CIS2_ISSUER=https://am.nhsint.auth-ptl.cis2.spineservices.nhs.uk
AUTH_CIS2_CLIENT_ID={CLIENT_ID}
AUTH_CIS2_CLIENT_SECRET={CLIENT_SECRET}
```

For `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` you can use `openssl rand -base64 32` or [https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32) to generate a random value.

## Testing

### Unit tests

Unit tests are written using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).

#### Running unit tests

To run unit tests, use the following command:

```
pnpm run test:unit
```

This will execute all unit tests and provide a summary of the tests results.

#### Running unit tests in watch mode

To run the unit tests in watch mode, use the following command:

```
pnpm run test:unit:watch
```

This will run the tests and re-run them whenever a file changes.

#### Coverage report

To generate a code coverage report, use the following command:

```
npm run test:unit:coverage
```

This will generate a coverage report in the `coverage` directory.

### End-to-end tests

End-to-end tests are written using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

Before running end-to-end tests make sure your development server is running locally on `http://localhost:3000`. Using the command `pnpm run dev`.

#### Running end-to-end tests

To run the end-to-end tests, use the following command:

```
pnpm run test:e2e:ui
```

This will open the Playwright test runner, where you can run the tests interactively.

### Running end-to-end tests in headless mode

To run the end-to-end tests in headless mode, use the following command:

```
pnpm run test:e2e
```

This will run the tests in headless mode and output the results to the terminal.
